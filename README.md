# üïπÔ∏è Raylib Convex Polygon Collision Demo

This project is a physics and collision demonstration made using **Raylib** and **C#**. It simulates interactions between convex polygons, allowing users to visualize collision detection algorithms (such as SAT and Diagonal Intersection techniques) in action.

## ‚ú® Features

- 2D physics interactions with gravity and dynamic response  
- Convex polygon collision detection using multiple algorithms  
- Visual debug mode to show collision vectors, normals, and points  
- Real-time keyboard controls and interactivity  
- C# project using [Raylib-cs](https://github.com/ChrisDill/Raylib-cs) bindings  

## üß† Inspiration

This project was inspired by the excellent work of [Javidx9 (OneLoneCoder)](https://github.com/OneLoneCoder/Javidx9), particularly his classic collision detection and game development tutorials. The goal was to reimplement some of his ideas and logic in a **Raylib** + **C#** environment, adapting them to my own style and to a modern game loop structure.
